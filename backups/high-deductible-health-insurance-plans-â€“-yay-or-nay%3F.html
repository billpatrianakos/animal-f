					<div id="single-post" class="">
						<p>From a consumer’s standpoint, this question is almost always going to be answered with a loud and clear, NAY; and for obvious reasons.  Why would they want to fork out more out-of-pocket expenses when they’re paying for health insurance policies specifically to eliminate those costs?  Makes sense.  However, the health insurance industry is, as of late, singing a different tune.<br />
Background
High-deductible plans are not a newcomer to the health insurance industry.  They’ve been around for years, mostly utilized by employers trying to save some cash, but they’ve recently been a hot topic of discussion with the rising prices in the health insurance industry.  Their characteristically low premiums often attract young, healthy individuals who are single and not worrying about the health of their children.<br />
In 2012, a reported 13.5 million people were insured under a high-deductible health insurance plan.  Growing rapidly, next year we’re expecting to see 19% of employers offering only high-deductible plans, with that number rising to as high as 44% in 2014.  The cause of this influx is no-doubt tied to the Affordable Care Act’s new regulations and the rising costs of healthcare that will be incurred by businesses big and small.<br />
Some large corporations have been on-board the high-deductible train for quite some time, including: General Electric, Wells Fargo, American Express, Whole Foods Inc., Walmart, Cigna and Bank of America.  Like most high-deductible plans, employees of these companies are provided with a Health Spending Account (HSA), to accumulate a tax-free savings for health expenses incurred pre-deductible.<br />
Pros and Cons of High-Deductible Health Plans
Pros:
•   Since patients are responsible for health costs up to their deductible, doctors will be more inclined to share the costs of health services, and less inclined to perform unnecessary procedures to make extra money, providing somewhat of a “checks and balances” system for healthcare.
•   For those in good health, these plans are actually cheaper than low-deductible, high-premium health insurance plans. 
•   Health Savings Accounts (HSA), tax free savings for medical expenses, roll over each year. While there is a limit on yearly contributions, $3,100 for single individuals and $6,250 for families, there is no account balance maximum. Beneficiaries may accumulate as much saved money as they’d like to help with expenses in case of a health emergency. 
•   High-deductible plans provide free preventative services to those who have not yet met their deductible, so vaccines, wellness exams, and other necessary preventative services will never be of cost with a high-deductible plan.
Cons:
•   Since members of high-deductible plans are subject to pay for medical expenses until they meet the deductible, many will forgo treatments and exams to avoid paying for them. It is said that those insured under these plans are three times more likely to put-off or skip care than those with low-deductible, high-premium plans. 
•   Out-of-pocket payments are very high. Single individuals could pay anywhere from $1,250-6,250 before their insurance kicks in, and those with a family can reach from $2,500-12,500 on a yearly basis. If faced with a medical emergency, these staggering numbers could potentially put a low-income individual or family in medical debt. 
•   Not every medical expense goes towards the deductible. The International Revenue Service (IRS) determines which expenses will be counted towards your health insurance deductible. Things like over-the-counter medication, for example, do not count towards the deductible. This means, those insured under these plans will be paying even more than their deductible on health expenses. 
There are benefits and drawbacks to any insurance policy, high-deductible or not. The question here is whether people are more willing to pay higher monthly premiums or higher out-of-pocket costs when they need medical treatment. What are your thoughts about high-deductible plans? Do you recommend them to your prospects, or shy away due to out-of-pocket expenses? Do you think they will become more popular with the implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act? Let us know what you think in the comments below.</p>
